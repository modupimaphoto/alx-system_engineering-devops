### Specifics Explanation:

1. Why Add Each Element:

- Second Application Server: Provides redundancy and load distribution for handling increased traffic and preventing a single point of failure in the application layer.
- Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes traffic among multiple application servers, improving performance and ensuring high availability.
- Database Primary-Replica Cluster: Enhances database reliability, provides read scalability, and ensures data availability even if one node fails.

2. Active-Active and Active-Passive Setup:

- Active-Active: Both application servers are actively handling requests simultaneously. This setup is beneficial for load balancing and maximizing resource utilization.
- Active-Passive:  Only one server actively handles requests while the other remains on standby. In case of a failure, the passive server becomes active. This setup minimizes resource usage but may lead to underutilization.

3. Database Primary-Replica Cluster:

- How it Works: The Primary Node processes write operations and replicates the data to the Replica Node, which can handle read operations. This ensures data consistency and availability.
- Difference between Primary and Replica Node: The Primary Node handles write operations, ensuring data consistency and durability. The Replica Node handles read operations, providing read scalability and fault tolerance. In the context of the application, read-heavy operations can be directed to the Replica Node, reducing the load on the Primary Node.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. SPOF (Single Point of Failure): The Database Primary Node is a potential single point of failure.

2. Security Issues: 

- No Firewall: Implement a firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic, enhancing security.
- No HTTPS: Secure the communication between the user and the web server by implementing HTTPS.

3. No monitoring:

- Lack of monitoring tools makes it challenging to detect and address issues promptly, monitoring tools track server health, performance, and security metrics.
